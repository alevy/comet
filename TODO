                              ACTIVE DHT
         
                             KNOWN ISSUES

- Security manager in place.
- Accounting/updating of memory utilization during runtime of active values.
- Accounting of updates on object size.

- Huge issue: Gets return the entire piece of code + instance. This means that
  all clients should be re-constructing the active objects inside a sandbox.
  What's the trust model here??????? Maybe we should have the code separated
  from the value after all.

- To be completely backward compatible w/ Vuze, enable all mechanisms (e.g.,
  cache replication, original replication, and join-time replication) for non-active
  values. Inserting some basic filtering inside each of these mechanisms should be
  enough.
